								<li>When buy/sell orders are matched, the execution price is typically inside the National Best Bid and Offer and reported with a delay</li>

							<p>	The Eolos Liquid Equity Long/Short alpha engine is a proprietary custom built algorithmic signature detection strategy.   Our unique combination of market, fundamental, trade and unstructured data analysis creates an inimitable perspective on the impact of market forces on an individual security or basket of securities.  Algorithmic strategies include trend following, mean reversion, momentum as well as nuanced multi-leg single or multi security strategies. The investment strategy deployed is by design cross sectional, unbiased and market direction agnostic.  The investment horizon: days, weeks, months.</p>
							<ul id="investment"> Approximate breadth of data: 
								<li>+ 3,500 companies</li>
								<li>+ 1,000 fundamental features (ie fixed assets, earnings etc)</li>

								<li>Data Periodicity: daily, monthly, quarterly, annual</li>
								<li>Look back: Over 10 years</li>
